## About Me

Hello! I am a final-year PhD student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), where I also got my master's degree. Prior to UMich, I got my bachelor's degree in bioinformatics from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://life.sjtu.edu.cn/En). Currently, I am fortunate to work with Dr. [Zhenke Wu](https://zhenkewu.com/)(UMich) and Dr. [Chengchun Shi](https://callmespring.github.io) from [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics)(LSE). 

## Research Interests

My research interest centers around the development and practice of statistical methods within the field of mobile health. My current focus is on reinforcement learning, causal inference and fairness in machine learning.
