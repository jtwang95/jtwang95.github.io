## About Me

Hello! I am a fourth-year PhD student in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/) at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu/), where I also got my master's degree. Prior to UMich, I got my bachelor's degree in bioinformatics from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://life.sjtu.edu.cn/En). Currently, I am fortunate to work with Dr. [Zhenke Wu](https://zhenkewu.com/)(UMich) and Dr. [Chengchun Shi](https://callmespring.github.io) from [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/statistics)(LSE).
